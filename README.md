# Memory Game

This is a fun matching game that tests your memory!

## To play:
There are 16 cards in the deck--two sets of eight matching cards. Your goal is to find all the matching cards.

Click on a black card in the deck, then click on any other card.
- If the cards match, you score a point.
- If they don't match, remember them for later.

Once all cards have been matched, you win! The game will present you with a popup that shows how long you took to win, as well as what your score was in stars (3 stars is the best).

If you get stuck, you can always hit the restart button at the top (the circle arrow icon). This will completely reset the game.
